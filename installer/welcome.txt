This is a demonstration version of the Quake Catcher Network software.

If you have a compatible computer; it will display accelerometer data which may be useful in sensing and/or demonstrating seismic events.

If you have an Internet connection, it will also get the latest USGS earthquake data which will be displayed on various views
in the graphics portion of the software.

For live participation in the Quake Catcher Network, please run the BOINC software (http://boinc.berkeley.edu)
