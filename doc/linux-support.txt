There is Linux support for QCN under BOINC as well as our standalone QCNLive program (QCNLive Linux version is at:  http://qcn.stanford.edu/sensor/download/qcnlive-linux.zip).  all graphics require Mesa or similar OpenGL 3D libraries installed so you may need to 'apt-get insall mesa3d' or similar if the program doesn't start

these only work with the Joywarrior 24F8 & F14 Tomcat USB sensors of course; and are sort of "experimental" or "beta versions" as I haven't been able to spend much time on Linux (it's just a "side project" as 99% of our participants are Mac & Windows).

basically I rely on the Linux joystick drivers being installed, which is common these days, but not all Linux distros put in the joystick device drivers.

if you have your sensor plugged in i.e. you should see a /dev/js0 or /dev/input/js0 or similar (I check for js0 through js2 as I assume one machine doesn't have multiple joysticks or sensors)

so if you see a /dev/js0 etc then you probably have the joystick drivers for Linux installed and can run QCNLive (if you also have the graphics/X11/OpenGL libraries) or QCN under BOINC.

for BOINC under Linux you can refer to this page:    http://boinc.berkeley.edu/wiki/Installing_on_Linux
