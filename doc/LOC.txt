I found the simplistic monitoring/location code set that I wrote, which has
a fake event triggers. It is not very good, but it has the basics.

1) unzip/tar

2) in src: make

3) in bin: ./fake_trigs_all: this creates a set of triggers for a
theoretical event. Assumes source time = 0.

4) run qcn_server_verify. This looks for a time when there are lots of
triggers.

I am sure this is too simplistic to be much help.

Note: it assumes semi-Cartesian coordinates. Works for small distances at
low latitudes. I have a subroutine I'll forward that does distances better.
