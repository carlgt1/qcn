I hope you find SACand associated utilities useful and appreciate any constructive suggestions, criticism, or contribution of macros and related codes.    It would also be very helpful if you could acknowledge our work using the following reference, Goldstein, P., D. Dodge, M. Firpo, Lee Minner (2003) "SAC2000: Signal processing  and analysis tools for seismologists and engineers, Invited contribution to "The IASPEI International Handbook of Earthquake and Engineering Seismology", Edited by WHK Lee, H. Kanamori, P.C. Jennings, and C. Kisslinger, Academic Press, London.  The rest of this message explains how use the enclosed distribution.  For additional information about SAC/SAC2000, see our web page at URL<http://www.iris.edu/manuals/sac/manual.htm>.Cheers,  Peter Goldsteinpeterg@llnl.gov* Installation and Prerequisites--------------------------------------------------------------------------- *** The following assumes you have X windows installed on your system. ***The .tgz file is a gzipped-tar file.  Its expanded version has a top directorysac/ and several files and subdirectories.  You can put the sac distributionwherever you like (provided you have permission to put it there) and you setyour environment variables appropriately (see below). For example, you can putsac in /usr/local/sac by putting the tgz file in /usr/local and expanding thearchive.* Unpacking the Distribution---------------------------------------------------------------------------If your version of tar has the "z" option, you can do this in one step:  tar zxvf "sac .tgz file" Otherwise you must first unzip and then untar the file.  One way to do this is  gzip -d -c XXX.tgz | tar -xf -  The contents of the package is as follows:sac/Readme           this filesac/History          update historysac/bin/             contains the prebuilt sac binary for your operating systemsac/bin/sac          Seismic Analysis Code binarysac/bin/sacswap      Changes endian of sac data file  (Not needed within sac)sac/bin/saclst       Stand-alone program to list header values.  Enter the                     command saclst help to get more details.sac/bin/sgftops      Conversion, Translation, Rotation, and Scaling of 		     postscript plots. sgftops is a stand-alone program but                      works only for SGF files created on a platform with the                      same byte order as the one on which it is run. sac/bin/sgftoeps.csh csh shell script that runs sgftops and then creates                      encapsulated postscript files that are compatible 		     with latex and Adobe Illustrator 10.                     The script requires:                        ghostscript (http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/).  sac/bin/sgftox.csh   csh shell script that is essentially sgftoeps.csh but                     creates a temporary .eps file and displays it to 		     screen using gv (if available) or ggv(Linux)sac/lib/             Libraries to be used in user generated sac programssac/lib/sacio.a      Library for reading and writing SAC filessac/aux/             contains files that are used by SAC during execution   sac/macros/          contains example macros and datasac/utils            sources sacswap.c, saclst.c, and sgftops.c plus makefilesac/License          the SAC Software End User License Agreementsac/Editline.license License for Editline for Command line edits and history* Environment Setup---------------------------------------------------------------------------For csh and tcsh use: 	setenv SACAUX /usr/local/sac/auxFor Bash use: 	export SACAUX=/usr/local/sac/aux You will either need to add /usr/local/sac/bin to your PATH or put in alink from a directory in your path to the executable:	ln -s /usr/local/sac/bin/sac /usr/local/bin/sac             * Variable: SAC_USE_DATABASE (when used, can slow processing)		Use Database		   If environment variable is undefined or set to 1	           % setenv SAC_USE_DATABASE 1		Do Not Use Database		  If environment variable is set to 0	           % setenv SAC_USE_DATABASE 0		   	* Variable: SAC_DISPLAY_COPYRIGHT (allows one to suppress this)		 Show Copyright		    If environment variable is undefined		Do Not Show Copyright		   If environment variable is defined	           % setenv SAC_DISPLAY_COPYRIGHT 1* Matlab Interface---------------------------------------------------------------------------If you have matlab 5.0 on solaris, set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include matlab shared object libraries:   setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/matlab/extern/lib/sol2This path may differ on your machine. You probably want to set the above environments in your .login, .tcshrc,  or .cshrc file so they get set each time you log in.  * Optional automated setup of environments---------------------------------------------------------------------------You may want to define a simple macro that runs whenever you start sac.  Todo this create a startup macro file (e.g., ~/macros/sac.init) and alias sacso that it starts with this macro: alias sac "/usr/local/bin/sac ~/macros/sacmac/sac.init"* If you need help ...---------------------------------------------------------------------------1.  Use the online help from within sac2.  Some features of sac are described in the Changes file in this directory.3.  A place to share problems and find solutions is the sac-help mailing list.    sac-help@iris.washington.edu    <http://www.iris.washington.edu/mailman/listinfo/sac-help>---------------------------------------------------------------------------If you are using a pre-built distribution, the following may be of interest:The Sun Solaris version was built on 2.9 using gmake but the normal suninstall.  The Mac version was built on 10.4.8 for both OSX/PPC and OSX/Intelusing gcc  3.3 for OSX/PPC and gcc 4.0.1 for OSX/Intel.  The Linux version wasbuilt on CentOS release 4.2 (Final) -- gcc version 3.4.4 20050721 (Red Hat3.4.4-2). For more information on supported operating systems, see History inthis directory.Now you are ready to run the executable enclosed with the distribution.    We hope you enjoy using sac.DO NOT DISTRIBUTE the SAC Software.  (That is what you agreed to whenyou accepted the license agreement.)
