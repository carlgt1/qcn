1. System Requirements

  - PC with USB host port
  - Linux x86, 2.6.12+ kernel
  - Web browser with Javascript enabled (Firefox)
  - CD-ROM drive
  - Internet connection recommended


2. Install

  The MotionNode software is distributed in a single folder as a Tarball. To
  install, simply un-tar the compressed package into your desired installation
  folder. For example, to install the software in the "/usr/local" folder run
  the following sequence of commands:

    $ tar zxf MotionNode_x86.tar.gz
    $ cd MotionNode_x86
    $ ./InitializeHome.sh
    $ cd ..
    $ sudo mv MotionNode_x86 /usr/local

  To run the MotionNode software as a daemon (in the background) type:

    $ /usr/local/MotionNode_x86/MotionNodeDaemon

  You should now be able to access the web browser based user interface at:

    http://127.0.0.1:32080/ or http://hostname:32080/


3. Getting Started

  See the "Getting Started" guide for more information. All documentation is
  available on our web site at:

    http://www.motionnode.com/documentation.html

  Note that the Linux version of the MotionNode software currently does not
  include:
  
  - MotionNode Viewer, standalone viewer application
  - MotionNode Monitor, tray application to monitor device arrival and
    automatically connect


4. Permissions

  The MotionNode Daemon requires read and write access to the data folder. You
  may choose any data folder in your initial setup, just be sure that the
  daemon can write files to it.

  Also, you may need to modify the permissions of the serial device node such
  that the daemon user has read and write access. Here is an example command
  to enable group level access to all USB serial nodes.

    $ chmod g+rw /dev/ttyUSB*


5. Distributions

  We have tested the MotionNode software on the following Linux distributions.
  
  - Ubuntu 7.04 and 7.10
  - openSUSE 10.3
  - Fedora Core 8
