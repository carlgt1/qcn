This is a demonstration version of the Quake Catcher Network software which usually runs "live" under the BOINC platform 
(http://boinc.berkeley.edu).

If a compatible accelerometor sensor is found, this software will also act as a "seismic monitoring/logging station" in that live data will be streamed
out every minute (as SAC files to the sac/ folder of your installation directory).

This is experimental software and is provided with no guarantees or warranties as to fitness of purpose.
